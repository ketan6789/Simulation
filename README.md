# Simulink Power Converters Simulation Repository

## Overview

This repository contains simulation files created using Simulink for various power converters, including rectifiers and inverters. The simulations are designed to model and analyze the performance of these power converters in different scenarios.

## Contents

1. **Rectifier Simulations:**
    - Half_Wave_Rectifier.slx: Simulation of a basic half wave rectifier circuit.
    - Full_Wave_Rectifier.slx: Simulation of a basic full wave rectifier circuit.

2. **Inverter Simulations:**
    - Inverter_Biipolar.slx: Simulation of a single-phase Bipolar inverter with pulse width modulation (PWM) control.
    - Inverter_Unipolar.slx: Simulation of a single-phase Uniipolar inverter with pulse width modulation (PWM) control.

2. **PWM Simulation**
    - Various PWM Simulations (Five Phase, Six Phase)
      
## Dependencies

- MATLAB R2023b 
- Simulink
