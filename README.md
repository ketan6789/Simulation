# Simulink Power Converters Simulation Repository

## Overview

This repository contains simulation files created using Simulink for various power converters, including rectifiers and inverters. The simulations are designed to model and analyze the performance of these power converters in different scenarios.

## Contents

1. **Rectifier Simulations:**
    - Half_Wave_Rectifier.slx: Simulation of a basic half wave rectifier circuit.
    - Full_Wave_Rectifier.slx: Simulation of a basic full wave rectifier circuit.

2. **Inverter Simulations:**
    - Inverter_Biipolar.slx: Simulation of a single-phase Bipolar inverter with pulse width modulation (PWM) control.
    - Inverter_Unipolar.slx: Simulation of a single-phase Uniipolar inverter with pulse width modulation (PWM) control.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ketan6789/Simulation.git
    ```

2. Open the Simulink files in MATLAB.

3. Run the simulations to observe the behavior of the power converters.

4. Modify the parameters and configurations to suit your specific needs.
