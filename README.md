Simulink Power Converters Simulation Repository
Overview
This repository contains simulation files created using Simulink for various power converters, including rectifiers and inverters. The simulations are designed to model and analyze the performance of these power converters in different scenarios.

Contents
Rectifier Simulations:

Half_Wave_Rectifier.slx: Simulation of a basic rectifier circuit.
Full_Wave_Rectifier.slx: Simulation of a three-phase rectifier with advanced control strategies.
Inverter Simulations:

Inverter_Bipolar.slx: Simulation of a single-phase Bipolar inverter with pulse width modulation (PWM) control.
Inverter_Unipolar.slx: Simulation of a single-phase Unipolar inverter with pulse width modulation (PWM) control.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ketan6789/Simulation.git
Open the Simulink files in MATLAB.

Run the simulations to observe the behavior of the power converters.

Modify the parameters and configurations to suit your specific needs.

Dependencies
